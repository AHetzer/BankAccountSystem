A simple bank account system utilizing inheritance to create functionality for a regular bank account, savings account, and checking account.

The savings account has a tiered interest system where if the account has $1000 or less the interest rate is 3%, 
between $1000 and $5000 is 5%, and above $5000 is 7%.
